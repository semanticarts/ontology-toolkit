## Sub-Commands

### Update

The `update` sub-command modifies ontology version and dependency information
```
$ onto_tool update -h
usage: onto_tool update [-h] [-f {xml,turtle,nt} | -i] [--debug] [-o OUTPUT]
                        [-b [{all,strict}]] [--retain-definedBy]
                        [--versioned-definedBy] [-v SET_VERSION]

                        [ontology [ontology ...]]

positional arguments:
  ontology              Ontology file or directory containing OWL files

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -f {xml,turtle,nt}, --format {xml,turtle,nt}
                        Output format
  -i, --in-place        Overwrite each input file with update, preserving
                        format
  --debug               Emit verbose debug output
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        Path to output file. Will be ignored if --in-place is
                        specified.
  -b [{all,strict}], --defined-by [{all,strict}]
                        Add rdfs:isDefinedBy to every resource defined. If the
                        (default) "strict" argument is provided, only
                        owl:Class, owl:ObjectProperty, owl:DatatypeProperty,
                        owl:AnnotationProperty and owl:Thing entities will be
                        annotated. If "all" is provided, every entity that has
                        any properties other than rdf:type will be annotated.
                        Will override any existing rdfs:isDefinedBy
                        annotations on the affected entities unless --retain-
                        definedBy is specified.

                        Update the import of DEPENDENCY to VERSION
```

### Export

The `export` sub-command will transform the ontology into the desired format, and remove version information, as required by tools such as Top Braid Composer.
```
usage: onto_tool export [-h] [-f {xml,turtle,nt} | -c CONTEXT] [--debug]
                        [-o OUTPUT] [-s] [-m IRI VERSION] [-b [{all,strict}]]

                        IRI and version
  -b [{all,strict}], --defined-by [{all,strict}]
                        Add rdfs:isDefinedBy to every resource defined. If the
                        (default) "strict" argument is provided, only
                        owl:Class, owl:ObjectProperty, owl:DatatypeProperty,
                        owl:AnnotationProperty and owl:Thing entities will be
                        annotated. If "all" is provided, every entity that has
                        any properties other than rdf:type will be annotated.
  --retain-definedBy    When merging ontologies, retain existing values of
                        rdfs:isDefinedBy
```

### Graphic

The `graphic` sub-command will create either 
* a comprehensive diagram showing ontology modules together with classes, object properties and individuals
  together with the path of imports, or (if the 'wee' option is selected) a simple diagram of the ontology
  import hierarchy, or
* a diagram of the use of classes and object and data properties in a triple store or local ontology files.
    
Graphics are exported both as ```png``` files and also as a ```dot``` file.  This ```dot``` file can be used with Graphviz or with web tools such as [Dot Viewer](http://www.semantechs.co.uk/turtle-editor-viewer/)

```
usage: onto_tool graphic [-h] [-e ENDPOINT] [--schema | --data]
                         [--single-ontology-graphs] [--debug] [-o OUTPUT]
                         [--show-shacl]
                         [--link-concentrator-threshold LINK_CONCENTRATOR_THRESHOLD]
                         [--instance-limit INSTANCE_LIMIT]
                         [--predicate-threshold PREDICATE_THRESHOLD]
                         [--include [INCLUDE [INCLUDE ...]] |
                         --include-pattern [INCLUDE_REGEX [INCLUDE_REGEX ...]]
                         | --exclude [EXCLUDE [EXCLUDE ...]] |
                         --exclude-pattern
                         [EXCLUDE_REGEX [EXCLUDE_REGEX ...]]] [-v VERSION]
                         [-w [WEE [WEE ...]]]
                         [--label-language LABEL_LANGUAGE]
                         [--hide [HIDE [HIDE ...]]] [--no-image] [-t TITLE]
                         [ontology [ontology ...]]

positional arguments:
  ontology              Ontology file, directory or name pattern

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -e ENDPOINT, --endpoint ENDPOINT
                        URI of SPARQL endpoint to use to gather data
  --schema              Generate ontology import graph (default)
  --data                Analyze instances for types and links
  --single-ontology-graphs
                        If specified in combination with --endpoint when
                        generating a schema graph, assume that every ontology
                        is in its own named graph in the triple store.
                        Otherwise rdfs:isDefinedBy will be used to locate
                        entities defined by each ontology.
  --debug               Emit verbose debug output
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        Output directory for generated graphics
  --show-shacl          Attempts to discover which classes and properties have
                        corresponding SHACL shapes and colors them green on
                        the graph. This detection relies on the presence of
                        sh:targetClass targeting, and can be confused by
                        complex logical shapes or Advanced SHACL features such
                        as SPARQL queries.
  --link-concentrator-threshold LINK_CONCENTRATOR_THRESHOLD
                        When the number links originating from the same class
                        that share a single predicate exceed this threshold
                        (default 10), use more compact display. Setting the
                        value to 0 disables this behavior.
  -v VERSION, --version VERSION
                        Version to place in graphic
  -w [WEE [WEE ...]], --wee [WEE [WEE ...]]
                        For ontologies matching the patterns specified, only
                        render the name and import information. If no patterns
                        are specified, applies to all ontologies.
  --label-language LABEL_LANGUAGE
                        In case entities have labels in multiple languages,
                        select either the specified language (default: en) or
                        a non-lanugage label.
  --hide [HIDE [HIDE ...]]
                        When visualizing data, hide classes and properties
                        matching the regexpatterns specified with this option.
  --no-image            Do not generate PNG image, only .dot output.
  -t TITLE, --title TITLE
                        Title to use for graph. If not supplied, the repo URI
                        will be used if graphing an endpoint, or 'Gist' if
                        graphing local files.

Sampling Limits:
  --instance-limit INSTANCE_LIMIT
                        Specify a limit on how many triples to consider that
                        use any one predicate to find (default 500000). This
                        option may result in an incomplete version of the
                        diagram, missing certain links.
  --predicate-threshold PREDICATE_THRESHOLD
                        Ignore predicates which occur fewer than
                        PREDICATE_THRESHOLD times (default 10)

Filters (only one can be used):
  --include [INCLUDE [INCLUDE ...]]
                        If specified for --schema, only ontologies matching
                        the specified URIs will be shown in full detail. If
                        specified with --data, only triples in the named
                        graphs mentioned will be considered (this also
                        excludes any triples in the default graph).
  --include-pattern [INCLUDE_REGEX [INCLUDE_REGEX ...]]
                        If specified for --schema, only ontologies matching
                        the specified URI pattern will be shown in full
                        detail. If specified with --data, only triples in the
                        named graphs matching the pattern will be considered
                        (this also excludes any triples in the default graph).
                        For large graphs this option is significantly slower
                        than using --include.
  --exclude [EXCLUDE [EXCLUDE ...]]
                        If specified for --schema, ontologies matching the
                        specified URIs will be omitted from the graph. If
                        specified with --data, triples in the named graphs
                        mentioned will be excluded (this also excludes any
                        triples in the default graph).
  --exclude-pattern [EXCLUDE_REGEX [EXCLUDE_REGEX ...]]
                        If specified for --schema, ontologies matching the
                        specified URI pattern will be omitted from the graph.
                        If specified with --data, triples in the named graphs
                        matching the pattern will be ignored (this also
                        excludes any triples in the default graph). For large
                        graphs this option is significantly slower than using
                        --exclude.
```

### Bundle

The `bundle` sub-command supports creating an ontology deployment containing both RDF and non-RDF artifacts for delivery or web hosting.

```
$ onto_tool bundle -h
usage: onto_tool bundle [-h] [--debug] [-v VARIABLE VALUE] bundle

positional arguments:
  bundle                JSON or YAML bundle definition

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --debug               Emit verbose debug output
  -v VARIABLE VALUE, --variable VARIABLE VALUE
                        Set value of VARIABLE to VALUE
```

The bundle definition is either YAML or JSON, and contains the following sections:

#### Variable definition

```yaml
variables:
  name: "gist"
  version: "X.x.x"
  input: "."
  rdf-toolkit: "{input}/tools/rdf-toolkit.jar"
  output: "{name}{version}_webDownload"
```
Variables are initialized with the default values provided, but can be overriden via the `--variable` command line option.
Values can reference other values using the `{name}` template syntax.

#### Tool definition

All tools require a `name` by which they are referenced in `transform` actions. Three different tool types are supported:
* Java tools (`type: "Java"`) require a path to the executable Jar file specified via the `jar` option,
  and a list of `arguments` that will be applied to each file processed.
  The `inputFile` and `outputFile` variables will be bound during execution, but other variables can be
  used to construct the arguments.
  tools:
  ```yaml
  - name: "serializer"
    type: "Java"
    jar: "{rdf-toolkit}"
    arguments:
      - "-tfmt"
      - "rdf-xml"
      - "-sdt"
      - "explicit"
      - "-dtd"
      - "-ibn"
      - "-s"
      - "{inputFile}"
      - "-t"
      - "{outputFile}"
  ```
* Shell tools (`type: "shell"`) execute a command specified via
  a list of `arguments` that will be applied to each file processed.
  The `inputFile` and `outputFile` variables will be bound during execution, but other variables can be
  used to construct the arguments.
  tools:
  ```yaml
    tools:
    - name: "java_version"
      type: "shell"
      arguments:
        - "java"
        - "-version"
  ```
* SPARQL tools apply a SPARQL Update query to each input file and serialize the resulting graph into the 
  output file. RDF format is preserved unless overridden with the `format` option. If the query is specified
  inline, template substitution will be applied to it, so bundle variables can be used, but double braces
  (`{{` instead of `{`, `}}` instead of `}`) have to be used to escape actual braces.
  ```yaml
    - name: "add-language-en"
      type: "sparql"
      query: >
        prefix skos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#>
        DELETE {{
          ?subject skos:prefLabel ?nolang .
        }}
        INSERT {{
          ?subject skos:prefLabel ?withlang
        }}
        where {{
          ?subject skos:prefLabel ?nolang .
          FILTER(lang(?nolang) = '')
          BIND(STRLANG(?nolang, '{lang}') as ?withlang)
        }}
  ```

#### Actions

Actions are executed in the order they are listed. Each action must have an `action` attribute,
and any action can contain a `message` attribute, the contents of which will be
emitted as a `INFO`-level log message prior to the execution of the action.

##### Basic File Manipulation
- `mkdir`, which requires a `directory` attribute to specify the path of the directory to be created 
  (only if it doesn't already exist)
- `copy`, which copies files into the bundle, and supports the following arguments:
  - `source`, `target`, `includes` and `excludes` - if neither `includes` or `excludes` is present,
   `source` and `target` are both  assumed to be file paths to a single file. If either`includes`
    or `excludes` is provided, `source` and `target` are 
    assumed to be directories, and each member of the `includes`/`excludes` lists is treated as a glob
    pattern inside the `source` directory. If `includes` is not present, it's presumed to be `*`, and
    `excludes` is applied after `includes`.
  - `rename` - If provided, must contain `from` and `to` attributes. When specified, each file
    is renamed as it is copied, where `from` is treated as a Python regular expression
    applied to the base name of the source file, and `to` is the substitution string which
    replaces it in the name of the target file. Backreferences are available for capturing groups, e.g.
    ```yaml
      rename:
        from: "(.*)\\.owl"
        to: "\\g<1>{version}.owl"
    ```
    will add a version number to the base name of each `.owl` file. Further documentation on
    Python regular expression replace functionality can be found
    [here](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html#search-and-replace).
  - `replace` - If provided, must contain `from` and `to` attributes. When specified, each file
    is processed after being copied, and each instance of the `from` pattern is replaced
    with `to` string in the file contents. Python regular expression syntax and backreferences are
    supported as shown in the `rename` documentation.
- `move`, which moves files according the provided options, which are identical to the ones supported
  by `copy`.
  
##### RDF Transformation

- `definedBy`, which inspects each input file to identify a single defined ontology, and then
  adds a `rdfs:isDefinedBy` property to every `owl:Class`, `owl:ObjectProperty`, `owl:DatatypeProperty`
  and `owl:AnnotationProperty` defined in the file referencing the identified ontology. Existing
  `rdfs:isDefinedBy` values are removed prior to the addition. Input and output file specification
  options are identical to those used by the `copy` action.
- `export`, which functions similarly to the command-line export functionality, gathering one or
  more input ontologies and exporting them as a single file, with some optional transformations,
  depending on the following specified options:
  - `source`, `target`, `includes` and `excludes` - treated identically to the `copy` operation
    described above, except `target` is always treated as a single file path.
  - `merge` - if provided, it must have two mandatory fields, `iri` and `version`. In this case, all
    ontologies declared in the input files are removed, and a single new ontologies, specified by the 
    `iri` is created, using `version` to build `owl:versionInfo` and `owl:versionIRI`. Any imports on
    the removed ontologies which are not satisfied internally are transferred to the new ontology.
  - `definedBy` - has two possible values, `strict` and `all`. If provided, a `rdfs:isDefinedBy` is
    added to all non-blank node subjects in the exported RDF linking them to the ontology defined in the
    combined graph. If more that one ontology is defined, the export will fail. If `strict` is specified,
    only classes and properties will be annotated, whereas `all` does not filter by type.
  - `retainDefinedBy` - by default, `definedBy` will override any existing `rdfs:definedBy` annotations,
    but if this option is provided, existing annotations will be left in place.
  - `format` - One of `turtle`, `xml`, or `nt` (N-Triples), specifies the output format for the export.
    The default output format is `turtle`.
  - `context` - If provided, generates a N-Quads export with the `context` argument as the name of the
    graph. When this option is present, the value of `format` is ignored.
  - `compress` - when this is `true`, the output is `gzip`-ed.
- `transform`, which applies the specified tool to a set of input files, and supports the following
  arguments:
  - `tool`, which references the `name` of a tool which must be defined in the `tools` section.
  - `source`, `target`, `includes` and `excludes`, which function just like they do for the `copy` and `move`
    actions, with each input and output path bound into the `inputFile` and `outputFile` variables
    before the tool arguments are interpreted.
  - `replace` and `rename`, which are applied after the tool invocation, and work as described above.
- `sparql` reads RDF files provided via the `source` and `includes`/`excludes` options and executes a SPARQL
  query on the resulting combined graph.
    * If the `query` option is a valid file path, the query is read from that file,
      otherwise the contents of the `query` option are interpreted as the query.
    * `SELECT` query results are stored in the file specified via `target` as a CSV.
    * RDF results from a `CONSTRUCT` query are
  stored as either Turtle, RDF/XML or N-Triples, depending on the `format` option (`turtle`, `xml`, or `nt`).
      Update queries will alter the input data in place, and the resulting
      graph will be output in the specified format.
    * `UPDATE` queries executed on local files will modify the in-memory graph and then serialize the
      resulting graph to the `target`.
    * The default functionality is to combine all RDF sources specified via `includes`
      and execute queries on the resulting graph. However, if `eachFile: true` is added,
      all queries will be applied to each source file separately, and will produce a 
      separate output file. In this case, `target` will be treated as a directory, and
      the `rename` option should be used when needed to construct the output file names. For example, the following
      action extracts the labels out of each RDF file into a separate CSV with matching names:
      ```yaml
      - action: 'sparql'

    * As an alternative to operating on local RDF specified via 'source', a query can
      be executed on a triple store by specifying an `endpoint`, which must
      contain a `query_uri`, and can optionally specify `user`/`password` which will
      authenticate via HTTP basic authentication. Update queries will modify the
      triple store directly, and a separate `update_uri` can be specified
      for databases which require it.

  
##### Utility Actions
- `markdown` transforms a `.md` file referenced in `source` into an HTML output specified in `target`.
- `graph` reads RDF files provided via the `source` and `includes`/`excludes` options and generates a graphical
  representation of the ontology, as in the `graphic` sub-command described above. Both `.dot` and
  `.png` outputs are written to the directory specified in the `target` option, and `title` and 
  `version` attributes configure the title on the generated graph. If `compact` is specified as
  `True`, a concise graph including only ontology names and imports is generated.

##### Validation
The `verify` action reads RDF files provided via the `source` and `includes`/`excludes` options and performs validation on the
resulting combined graph. If the validation fails, the bundle process exits with a non-zero status and
does not execute subsequent actions. The type of verification performed depends on the 
value of the `type` option:
* If `type` is `select`, one or more SPARQL `SELECT` queries are executed against the graph, and the
  first query to return a non-empty result will terminate the bundle. The results of the query will
  be output to the log, and also written as CSV to a file path specified by the `target` option, if
  provided. Queries can be specified in one of two ways (only one can be present):
  * If the `query` option is a valid file path, the query is read from that file,
    otherwise the contents of the `query` option are interpreted as the query, e.g.
    ```yaml
    query: >
      prefix skos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#>
      select ?unlabeled where {{
        ?unlabeled a ?type .
        filter not exists {{ ?unlabeled skos:prefLabel ?label }}
      }}
    ```
  * If `queries` is provided, a list of queries will be built from the `source` and `includes`/`excludes`
    sub-options. The queries will be executed in order specified. If `stopOnFail` is omitted or
    is `true`, the first  query that produces a failing result will cause `verify` to abort. If
    `stopOnFail` is `false`, all queries will be executed regardless of failures, and the value
    of `target` is treated as a directory where the results of _each_ failing query will be written.
    ```yaml
      - action: 'verify'
        type: 'select'
        source: '{input}'
        includes:
          - 'verify_data.ttl'
        target: '{output}/verify_select_results'
        stopOnFail: false
        queries:
          source: '{input}'
          includes:
            - 'verify_*_select_query.rq'
    ```
* If `type` is `ask`, one or more SPARQL `ASK` queries will be executed. Queries are
  specified similarly to the `select` validation. Unless `stopOnFail` is set to `false`, the first
  query producing a result that does not match the required `expected` option, the bundle will terminate.
  For example:
  ```yaml
  actions:
    - action: 'verify'
      type: 'ask'
      source: '{input}'
      includes:
        - 'verify_data.ttl'
      queries:
        source: '{input}'
        includes:
          - '*_ask_query.rq'
      expected: false
  ```
* If `type` is `shacl`, a SHACL shape graph will be constructed from the file specified via the `shapes`
  option (which must have a `source`, and optionally `includes`/`excludes`), with the bundle terminating only if
  any `sh:Violation` results are present, unless the `failOn` option specifies otherwise.`
  The report is emitted to the log, and saved as Turtle to the path specified in the `target` option if it's provided.
  For example:
  ```yaml
  - action: 'verify'
    type: 'shacl'
    inference: 'rdfs'
    source: '{input}'
    includes:
      - 'verify_data.ttl'
    target: '{output}/verify_shacl_errors.ttl'
    failOn: "warning"
    shapes:
      source: '{input}/verify_shacl_shapes.ttl'
  ```
  If the `inference` option is provided, the reasoner will be run on the graph prior
  to applying the SHACL rules. The valid values are:
    * `rdfs`,
    * `owlrl`,
    * `both`, or
    * `none` (default).
* If `type` is `construct`, the queries are expected to `CONSTRUCT` a [SHACL ValidationReport](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/#validation-report).
  The validation will be considered as a failure if the resulting graph is non-empty. `target`,
  `stopOnFail` and `query`/`queries` are handled same as `select` validation, and `failOn` is used to determine which
  violations will terminate execution.
* Validation can be performed against a SPARQL endpoint instead of local RDF
  data by specifying `endpoint` instead of `source`/`includes`. `endpoint` must
  contain a `query_uri`, and can optionally specify `user`/`password` which will
  authenticate via HTTP basic authentication. For example:
  ```
  - action: 'verify'
    type: 'construct'
    endpoint:
      query_uri: 'https://my.endpoint.com/sparql'
      user: 'test-user'
      password: 'test-user'
    target: '{output}/verify_construct_results'
    stopOnFail: false
    query: '{input}/verify_via_construct.rq'
  ```
